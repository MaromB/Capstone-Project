The increasing demand for seamless connectivity and the growing complexity of wireless mesh networks have led to a pressing need to address the optimization of router placement. As wireless technologies advance and users rely heavily on network connectivity, ensuring efficient router positioning becomes paramount to achieve optimal network performance. In response to this need, researchers have explored various approaches and algorithms to optimize router placement in wireless mesh networks. Some prior studies have explored techniques such as Hill climbing Optimization, genetic algorithm, and Coyote Optimization algorithm in order to solve this problem. In our article, we focus on two specific algorithms, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA), to tackle the router placement optimization problem. We have chosen the above algorithms due to their inherent characteristics and proven effectiveness in optimization tasks. In our research, we plan to utilize the PSO and GA algorithms to optimize router placement in wireless mesh networks, A process that will enable us to reach near optical solutions.
